# lepus
Lepus is an ordering system based on Symfony 2 PHP, Javascript, jQuery, HTML5 and CSS.

The idea behind Lepus is a seller or supplier may request an order in the web application, to the headquarters of the company. The headquarters can view, organize and determine the workflow for each order.
There are products to sell, customers to ship products and different stores where they collect products.
The order has a date and time, an order number, a customer, a delivery address, products, and the amount of each product.
